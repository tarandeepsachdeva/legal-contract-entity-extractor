(c) notice and procedures. promptly after receipt by an indemni ed party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemni ed party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; provided, that the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have to any indemni ed party except to the extent such indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced by such failure. in case any such action shall be brought against any indemni ed party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noti ed, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemni ed party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such 22 indemni ed party of the indemnifying party s election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemni ed party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemni ed party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that if, in the sole judgment of the indemni ed party, it is advisable for the indemni ed party to be represented by separate counsel, the indemni ed party shall have the right to employ a separate counsel to represent it, in which event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemni ed party or parties except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been speci cally authorized by the indemnifying party in writing, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such separate counsel, a material con ict on any material issue between the position of the indemnifying party and the position of the indemni ed party, in which case, if such indemni ed party noti es the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemni ed party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate  rm of attorneys at any time for all such indemni ed parties. an indemnifying party shall not be obligated under any settlement agreement relating to any action under this section 7 to which it has not agreed in writing. in addition, no indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemni ed party, e ect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemni ed party for all liability on claims that are the subject matter of the proceeding. (d) contribution; limitation on liability. if the indemni cation provided for in this section 7 is unavailable or insu cient to hold harmless an indemni ed party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemni ed party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemni ed party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to re ect the relative bene ts received by the company on the one hand and the placement agents on the other from the o ering of the shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to re ect not only the relative bene ts referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the company on the one hand and the placement agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. the relative bene ts received by the company on the one hand and the placement agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the o ering (before deducting expenses) received by the company bears to the total placement agent fees received by the placement agents. the relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the company or the placement agents and the parties  relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. the company and the placement agents agree that they would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the placement agents were 23 treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the  rst sentence of this subsection (d). the amount paid or payable by an indemni ed party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the  rst sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemni ed party (and not reimbursed by the indemnifying party) in connection with investigating or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no placement agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which (x) the total fee received by such placement agent in accordance with section 1(a) exceeds (y) the amount of any damages that such placement agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of section 11(f) of the securities act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. the placement agents  obligations in this section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the compensation received by each of the placement agents and not joint. (e) non-exclusive remedies. the obligations of the company under this section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the placement agents within the meaning of the securities act; and the obligations of the placement agents under this section 7 shall be in addition to any liability that the placement agents may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the registration statement as about to become a director of the company), to each o cer of the company who has signed the registration statement and to each person, if any, who controls the company within the meaning of the securities act. 8. representations and agreements to survive delivery. all representations, warranties, and agreements of the company herein or in certi cates delivered pursuant hereto, and the agreements of the placement agents and the company contained in section 7 hereof, shall remain operative and in full force and e ect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the placement agents or any controlling person thereof, or the company or any of its o cers, directors, or controlling persons and shall survive delivery of, and payment for, the shares. the respective agreements, covenants, indemnities and other statements set forth in sections 5, 7 and 9 hereof shall remain in full force and e ect, regardless of any termination of this agreement. 9. termination.
