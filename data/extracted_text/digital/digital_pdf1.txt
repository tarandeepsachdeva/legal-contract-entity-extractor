("warrantholder"). in consideration of the mutual terms, conditions, representations, warranties and agreements herein set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: section 1. issuance of warrants. the company hereby issues and grants to warrantholder 137,138 warrants ("warrants") to purchase shares of series b convertible preferred stock of the company (the "preferred stock"). each warrant shall entitle the holder, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to exercise set forth in section 7 of this agreement, to purchase on or after the date hereof until december 31, 2015 (the "warrant expiration date") one share of preferred stock (the shares of preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants being collectively referred to herein as the "warrant shares") at an exercise price of $0.01 per warrant share (the "exercise price"). the shares of preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants shall have the terms, preferences, rights and be subject to the limitations set forth in the certificate of designation previously filed with the office of the secretary of state of delaware. the number of warrant shares issuable on exercise of each warrant and the exercise price are all subject to adjustment pursuant to section 8 of this agreement. section 2. form of warrant certificates. promptly after the execution and delivery of this agreement by the parties hereto, the company shall cause to be executed and delivered to warrantholder one or more certificates evidencing the warrants (the "warrant certificates"). each warrant certificate delivered hereunder shall be substantially in the form set forth in exhibit a attached hereto and may have such letters, numbers or other identification marks and legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the company may deem appropriate and that are not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement or as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation. each warrant certificate shall be dated the date of execution by the company. section 3. execution of warrant certificates. each warrant certificate delivered hereunder shall be signed on behalf of the company by its president or chief executive officer and by its secretary or an assistant secretary. each such signature may be in the form of a facsimile thereof and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the warrant certificates. if any officer of the company who signed any warrant certificate ceases to be an officer of the company before the warrant certificate so signed shall have been delivered by the company, such warrant certificate nevertheless may be delivered as though such person had not ceased to be such officer of the company. section 4. registration. warrant certificates shall be issued in registered form only. the company will keep or cause to be kept books for registration of ownership and transfer of each warrant certificate issued pursuant to this agreement. each warrant certificate issued pursuant to this agreement shall be numbered by the company and shall be registered by the company in the name of the holder thereof (initially the warrantholder). the company may deem and treat the registered holder of any warrant certificate as the absolute owner thereof (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by anyone) for the purpose of any exercise thereof and for all other purposes, and the company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. section 5. restrictions on transfer. no warrant may be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed of (each a "transfer") unless (i) the transfer complies with all applicable securities laws and (ii) the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this agreement and executes and delivers to the company any documents and instruments requested by the company, including without limitation, an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the company, that such transfer does not violate any applicable federal or state securities laws. section 6. mutilated or missing warrant certificates. if any warrant certificate is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the company shall issue, upon surrender and cancellation of any mutilated warrant certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for any lost, stolen or destroyed warrant certificate, a new warrant certificate of like tenor and representing an equal number of warrants. in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed warrant certificate, a new warrant certificate shall be issued by the company only upon the company's receipt of reasonably satisfactory evidence of such loss, theft or destruction and, if requested, an indemnity or bond reasonably satisfactory to the company. section 7. exercise of warrants. a. exercise. subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this section 7, warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part (but not as to any fractional part of a warrant), at any time or from time to time after the date hereof until on or prior to the warrant expiration date. in order to exercise any warrant, warrantholder shall deliver to the company at its office referred to in section 16 the following: (i) a written notice in the form of the election to purchase appearing at the end of the form of warrant certificate attached as exhibit a hereto of such warrantholder's election to exercise the warrants, which notice shall specify the number of such warrantholder's warrants being exercised; (ii) the warrant certificate or warrant certificates evidencing the warrants being exercised; and (iii) payment of the aggregate exercise price. all rights of warrantholder with respect to any warrant that has not been exercised on or prior to the warrant expiration date shall immediately cease and such warrants shall be automatically cancelled and void. 1. b. payment of exercise price. payment of the exercise price with respect to warrants being exercised hereunder shall be by the payment to the company, in cash, by check or wire transfer, of an amount equal to the exercise price multiplied by the number of warrants then being exercised. the warrants also may be exercised at such time by means of a "cashless exercise" in which the holder shall be entitled to receive a certificate for the number of warrant shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(a-b) (x)] by (a), where: 2 (a) = the fair market value of a warrant share as of the date of exercise of the warrants then being exercised; (b) = the exercise price of this warrant, as adjusted; and (x) = the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant certificates surrendered for exercise in accordance with the terms of this warrant agreement by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise. c. delivery of warrant shares. upon receipt of the items referred to in section 7a, subject to any withholding that may be required by law and the payment by the warrantholder of any transfer taxes due if the warrant shares are to be registered in a name other than that of warrantholder, the company shall, as promptly as practicable, execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered, to or upon the written order of warrantholder, and in the name of warrantholder or warrantholder's designee, a stock certificate or stock certificates representing the number of warrant shares to be issued on exercise of the warrant(s). the certificates issued to warrantholder or its designee shall bear any restrictive legend required under applicable law, rule or regulation. a warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised and such stock certificate or stock certificates shall be deemed to have been issued, and such holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date that such notice, together with payment of the aggregate exercise price and the warrant certificate or warrant certificates evidencing the warrants to be exercised, is received by the company as aforesaid. if the warrants evidenced by any warrant certificate are exercised in part, the company shall, at the time of delivery of the stock certificates, deliver to the holder thereof a new warrant certificate evidencing the warrants that were not exercised or surrendered, which shall in all respects (other than as to the number of warrants evidenced thereby) be identical to the warrant certificate being exercised. any warrant certificates surrendered upon exercise of warrants shall be canceled by the company. d. fair market value. for purposes of determining the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of warrants in accordance with the preceding subsection c, the fair market value of the warrant shares shall mean as of the date of exercise (the "determination date"): (i) if the warrant shares are traded on an exchange or are quoted on the national association of securities dealers, inc. automated quotation ("nasdaq") national market system, the average of the closing or last sale price, respectively, of the warrant shares as reported for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the determination date; (ii) if the warrant shares are not traded on an exchange or on the nasdaq national market system but are traded in the over-the-counter market, then the average of the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for a share of such stock reported for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the determination date; and (iii) if the warrant shares are not publicly traded, then as determined in good faith by the disinterested members of the company's board of directors as being the price per share which the company could reasonably obtain from a willing buyer (who is not an employee or director) for authorized but unissued shares of warrant shares. section 8. adjustment of number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant and adjustment of exercise price. a. adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations. the number of warrant shares issuable upon exercise of each warrant and the exercise price shall each be proportionately adjusted to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization or the like affecting the number of outstanding shares of preferred stock that occurs after the date hereof. 3 b. adjustments for reorganization, consolidation, merger. if after the date hereof, the company (or any other entity, the stock or other securities of which are at the time receivable on the exercise of the warrants), consolidates with or merges into another entity or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to another entity, then, in each such case, warrantholder, upon any permitted exercise of a warrant (as provided in section 7), at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the stock or other securities and property receivable upon the exercise of the warrant prior to such consummation, the stock or other securities or property to which such warrantholder would have been entitled upon the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance if such warrantholder had exercised the warrant immediately prior thereto, subject to such further adjustments as may be required as a result of the occurrence after such consolidation or merger of the events described in this section 8. the successor or purchasing entity in any such reorganization, consolidation, merger or conveyance (if other than the company) shall duly execute and deliver to warrantholder a written acknowledgment of such entity's obligations under the warrants and this agreement. section 9. reservation of shares. the company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued preferred stock, or its authorized and issued preferred stock held in its treasury, the aggregate number of the warrant shares deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue the warrant shares upon the due and punctual exercise of the warrants, through the warrant expiration date. section 10. no impairment. the company shall not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, willfully avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the warrants or this agreement, and shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of warrantholder under the warrants and this agreement against wrongful impairment. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the company: (i) shall not set or increase the par value of any warrant shares above the amount payable therefor upon exercise, and (ii) shall take all actions that are necessary or appropriate in order that the company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable warrant shares upon the exercise of the warrants. section 11. representations and warranties of warrantholder. warrantholder represents and warrants to the company that, on the date hereof and on the date the warrantholder exercises the warrant pursuant to the terms of this agreement: (i) warrantholder is an "accredited investor", as such term is defined in rule 501(a) of regulation d promulgated under the securities act. (ii) warrantholder understands that the warrants and the warrant shares have not been registered under the securities act and acknowledges that the warrants and the warrant shares must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the securities act or an exemption from such registration becomes available. 4 (iii) warrantholder is acquiring the warrants for warrantholder's own account for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. section 12. no rights or liabilities as stockholder. no holder, as such, of any warrant certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed the holder of preferred stock which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the warrants represented thereby for any purpose whatever, nor shall anything contained herein or in any warrant certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any warrant certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether upon any recapitalization, issuance of stock, reclassification of stock, change of par value or change of stock to no par value, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders or to receive dividend or subscription rights, or otherwise, until such warrant certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof and the receipt and collection of the exercise price and any other amounts payable upon such exercise by the company. no provision hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by warrantholder to purchase warrant shares shall give rise to any liability of such holder for the exercise price or as a stockholder of the company, whether such liability is asserted by the company or by creditors of the company. section 13. right of first refusal. (a) the first time the warrantholder receives a bona fide offer to purchase shares (as defined in this section) which it intends to accept, the company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase all but not less than all of the warrants shares or the securities issuable upon conversion of the warrant shares (the "conversion shares," and together with the warrant shares, the "shares"), as the case may be, to be sold from a warrantholder at the formula price set forth in subsection (b) below. for purposes hereof, a bona fide sale is a sale of the entire right title and interest to the shares at a price reasonably approximating the then fair market value thereof, but shall not include any sale to taglich brothers, inc. ("taglich") or an affiliate (as defined in rule 405 promulgated under the securities act of 1933, as amended) of taglich or the warrantholder. the warrantholder shall give the company written notice of any proposed sale of shares (the "notice of sale") not less than 10 days prior to the consummation of that sale (the "scheduled sale date"), which notice shall identify the proposed purchaser, the total and per share purchase price, the scheduled sale date and other material terms of the proposed sale, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the offer to purchase. the shares which are the subject of a notice of sale shall be referred to as the "offered shares." the company shall have 8 days from the receipt of the notice of sale to notify the warrantholder of its intention to exercise its right of first refusal with respect to the proposed sale and must consummate the purchase of the offered shares by the scheduled sale date. the company shall be deemed to have declined to exercise its right of first refusal if the company does not deliver a timely notice of sale to the holder or if the notice of sale is delivered to the warrantholder on a timely basis, the company fails to consummate the sale by the scheduled sale date. if the first time the warrantholder proposes to sell shares it is proposing to sell less than all of the shares held by it, the company shall have a right of first refusal as provided herein when the warrantholder proposes to sell the balance of the shares. (b) the per share purchase price of offered shares to be paid by the company upon exercise of the company's right of first refusal set forth in subsection (a) above shall be an amount equal to the excess of (i) the per share purchase price set forth in the notice of sale over (ii) $2.99 (the "hurdle price"), provided that if the per share purchase price set forth in the notice of sale is equal to or less than the hurdle price, upon exercise of its right of first refusal the company shall have the right to redeem all of the offered 5 shares for an aggregate consideration of $10.00 and further provided that upon adjustment of the warrant shares as provided in section 8 (subject to such successive further adjustments as may be required as a result of the adjustment of the securities issuable upon exercise of the warrant shares) or conversion of the warrant shares (subject to such successive further adjustments as may be required as a result of the conversion of the securities issuable upon conversion of the warrant shares) in accordance with the terms thereof, the hurdle price shall be allocated pro-rata amongst the securities issuable upon such adjustment or conversion. [note - the $2.99 is a placeholder. the number is intended to equal the fair market value of the class b as determined for purposes of allocating the purchase price received for subscriptions in september 2008 less 1 cent. i am waiting for scott to come back to get the number] for example, if the per share price offered to a warrantholder for offered shares (then comprised of class b preferred stock) was $10.00, the price payable by the company upon exercise of the right of first refusal would be $7.01 and if the per share price offered to a warrantholder for offered shares (then comprised of class b preferred stock) was $7.01 or less, the company could redeem the offered shares for an aggregate of $10.00. if a warrantholder proposes to sell any shares on an exchange or over-the-counter, then, for purposes of determining the per share price at which the company may redeem the offered shares, the fair market value of the shares (determined in accordance with section 7 d) as of the date of the notice of sale shall be substituted for the price which might have been offered by a third party and set forth in the notice of sale. (c) the warrantholder understands and acknowledges that the certificate(s) evidencing the warrant shares and the conversion shares shall be endorsed with a legend which refers to the company's right of first refusal set forth in this section. section 14. definitions. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in this section 14, whenever used in this agreement shall have the respective meanings hereinafter specified and words in the singular or in the plural shall each include the singular and the plural and the use of any gender shall include all genders.
