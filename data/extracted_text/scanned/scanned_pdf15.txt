advertisement or notice shall be inscribed, painted, affixed or displayed on any part of the outside or the inside of the building except on the directories and the doors of offices, and then only in such place, number, size, material color and style as is approved by lessor, and if any such sign, advertisement or notice is exhibited, lessor shall have the right to remove the same and lessee shall be liable for any and all expenses incurred by lessor by said removal, lessee hereby agreeing to reimburse lessor upon demand for all such expenses incurred by 10 lessor. any such permitted use, including directories and name plates, shall be at the sole expense and cost of the lessee. lessor shall have the right to prohibit any advertisement of lessee which in its opinion tends to impair the

bulky matter of any description will be received into the building or carried in the elevators except as approved by lessor. all moving of furniture, equipment and other material within the public

and repairs to the demised premises, the building or other premises as the lessor may deem necessary; to exhibit the same to potential or actual mortgagees or purchasers of said building; and during the last six (6) months of the lease term, to exhibit the same to prospective tenants. no such access by lessor or those claiming by or through lessor shall constitute a constructive eviction or a basis for an abatement of rent, nor shall lessee be entitled to any compensation on account thereof. lessor shall exercise reasonable efforts to give lessee prior notice of such access, and, when making such access, to minimize the interference with lessee's business operations; provided, however, the foregoing shall not be construed to require lessor to limit such access to non-business hours or to limit the number of persons permitted access to the demised premises hereunder. 13). insurance rating lessee will not conduct or permit to be conducted any activity, or place any equipment in or about the demised premises, which will, in any way, increase the rate of fire insurance or other insurance on the building; and if any increase in the rate of fire insurance or other insurance is

increase in such rate is due to such activity or equipment and, as a result thereof, lessee shall be liable for such increase as additional rent and upon notification thereof by lessor shall reimburse lessor therefore. 14. lessee's equipment lessee will not install or operate in the demised premises any electrically operated equipment or other machinery, other than electric typewriters, adding machines, radios, televisions, tape recorders, dictaphones, bookkeeping machines, telefax machines, personal computers and associated peripheral equipment, copy machines, coffee machines, microwave

of the utilities, for additional wear, tear or depreciation to base building equipment occasioned from such usage, and for the cost of additional wiring as may be occasioned by the operation of said equipment of a kind or nature whatsoever which will or may necessitate any changes, replacements or additions to, or in the use, the water system, heating system, plumbing system, air-conditioning system, or electrical system of the demised premises or the building. business machines and mechanical equipment belonging to lessee which cause noise or vibration that may be transmitted to the structure of the building or to any space therein to such a degree as to be objectionable to lessor or to any tenant in the building shall be installed and 10 11 maintained by lessee, at lessee's expense, on vibration eliminators or other devices sufficient to eliminate such noise and vibration. 15. indemnity lessee will defend, indemnify and hold harmless lessor from and against any loss,

through friday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on saturday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. exclusive of sundays and holidays during such seasons of the year when such services are normally and usually furnished in the modern office buildings in the washington, d.c. metropolitan area; routine maintenance, painting and electric lighting service for all public areas, garage and special service areas of the building in the manner and to the extent deemed by lessor to be standard; proper electrical facilities to furnish sufficient power to machines of low electrical consumption provided, however, that, except for reasonable quantities of low electrical consumption equipment which lessee is permitted to install in the demised premises pursuant to section 14 without lessor's consent, lessee shall bear the utility costs occasioned by electro-data processing machines, including air-conditioning costs therefor, mini computers, mainframe computers and similar machines of high electrical consumption; all subject to federal, state and county governmental controls and regulations; but failure by lessor to any extent to furnish these defined services, or any cessation thereof, resulting from causes beyond the control of lessor, shall not render lessor liable in any respect for damages to either person or property, nor be construed as an eviction of lessee, nor work an abatement of rent, nor relieve lessee from fulfillment of any covenant or agreement hereof. should any of the building equipment or machinery break down, or for any cause cease to function properly, lessor shall, upon receipt of notice from lessee of the need therefore, use reasonable diligence to repair the same promptly, but lessee shall have no claim for rebate of rent or damages on account of any interruptions

lessee's employees shall have access to the building and the demised premises twenty-four (24) hours per day, three hundred sixty-five (365) days per year. subject to the terms hereof, regular maintenance and repairs, and circumstances and events beyond the reasonable control of lessor, lessor shall provide heat and air conditioning at times in addition to those specified above, at lessee's

lessee shall pay lessor for said after-hours service based upon lessor's building standard service charge then-in effect and subject to change from time to time (currently nineteen dollars ($19.00) per hour per floor), plus lessor's additional charge as then-in effect and subject to change from time to time (currently thirty dollars ($30.00) per hour (regardless of the number of floors)) when an engineer's presence is required or requested by lessee. the foregoing charges shall be subject to annual revision by lessor. notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, lessee shall reimburse lessor upon demand for all electrical consumption and demand charges attributable to electricity provided through the sub-panel installed by lessor in the demised premises, or otherwise provided for or consumed by any supplemental heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment or other equipment installed by or on behalf of lessee. without limiting the a 12 foregoing, lessee shall reimburse lessor for all such electrical usage, including demand and consumption charges attributable to such usage (lessee hereby acknowledging and agreeing that lessee shall bear demand charges attributable to electricity consumption during summer peak months, even though a portion of such demand changes may be imposed during the nine (9) months after such summer peak months) based on a sub-metered calculation of such usage. 17. responsibility for certain damage and breakage all injury to the demised premises or the building of which they are a part, and all breakage and damage done by lessee or the agents, servants, licensees, contractors, employees and visitors of lessee, shall be repaired promptly by the lessee, at the expense of the lessee. in the event that the lessee shall fail so to do, then the lessor shall have the right to make necessary repairs, alterations and replacements, structural, non-structural, or otherwise, and any charge or cost so incurred by the lessor shall be paid by the lessee with the right on the part of the lessor to elect in its discretion to regard the same as additional rent, in which event such cost or charge shall become additional rent payable with the installment of monthly base rent next becoming due or thereafter falling due under the terms of this lease. this provision shall be construed as an additional remedy granted to the lessor and not in limitation of any other rights and remedies which the lessor has or may have in said circumstances. the exercising of lessor's right to cure will not excuse the failure of lessee to perform its obligations hereunder. 18. bankruptcy (a) if at any time during the lease term, a petition shall be filed, either by or against the lessee, in any court or pursuant to any federal, state, or municipal statute whether in bankruptcy, insolvency, for the appointment of a receiver of the lessee's property or because of any general assignment made by the lessee of the lessee's property for the benefit of the lessee's creditors, then immediately upon the happening of any such event, and without any entry or other act by the lessor, this lease, at lessor's option, shall cease and come to an end with the same force and effect as if the date of the happening of any such event were the date herein fixed for the expiration of the lease term. it is further stipulated and agreed that, in the event of the termination of the lease term by the happening of any such event, the lessor shall forthwith, upon such termination, and any other provisions of this lease to the contrary notwithstanding, become entitled to recover as and for liquidated damages caused by such breach of the provisions of this lease, an amount equal to the difference between the then cash value of the rent reserved hereunder for the unexpired portion of the term and the then cash rental value of the demised premises for such unexpired portion of the lease term hereby demised, unless the statute which governs or shall govern the proceeding in which such damages are to be proved limits or shall limit the amount of such claim capable of being so proved, in which case the lessor shall be entitled to prove as and for liquidated damages an amount equal to that allowed by or under any such statute. the provisions of this section of this lease shall be without prejudice to the lessor's right to prove in full damages for rent accrued prior to the termination of this lease, but not paid. this provision of this lease shall be without prejudice to any rights given to the lessor by any pertinent statute to prove any amounts allowed thereby. (b) in making any such computation, the then cash rental value of the demised premises shall be deemed prima-fade to be the present cash value (utilizing a 6% discount rate) of rental realized upon any re-letting, if such re-letting can be accomplished by the lessor within a reasonable time after such termination of this lease, and the then present cash value of the future rents hereunder reserved to the lessor for the unexpired portion of the term hereby demised shall be deemed to be such sum, if invested at six per cent (6%) simple interest, as will produce the future rent over the period of time in question. 19: liability for damage to personal property and person all personal property of the lessee, its employees, agents, business invitees, licensees, customers, clients, family members, guests or trespassers in and on said demised premises, shall be and remain at their sole risk, and lessor shall not be liable to them for any damage to, or loss of such personal property arising from any act of negligence of any other persons nor from the leaking of the roof, or from the bursting, leaking or overflowing of water, sewer or steam pipes, or from heating or plumbing fixtures, or from electrical wires or fixtures, or from air- 12 13 conditioning failure, or from any other cause whatsoever, nor shall the lessor be liable for the interruption or loss to lessee's business arising from any of the above described acts or causes, nor shall the lessor be liable for any personal or bodily injury to the lessee, its employee, agents, business invitees, licensees, contractors, customers, clients, family members, guests or trespassers arising from the use, occupancy and condition of the demised premises or building; the lessee especially agreeing to defend, indemnify and save the lessor harmless in all such cases from and against any loss, damage, or liability (including attorney's fees) arising therefrom. 20): damage to the demised premises if the demised premises shall be damaged by fire or other cause without the fault or neglect of lessee, lessor shall diligently and as soon as practicable after such damage occurs (taking into account the time necessary to effectuate a satisfactory settlement with any insurance company) repair such damage (but excluding lessee's furniture, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, improvements and/or alterations) at the expense of the lessor, and the monthly base rent shall be reduced in proportion to the extent the demised premises are rendered untenantable, until such repairs are completed, provided, however, that if the building is damaged by fire or other cause to such extent that the damage cannot be fully repaired within sixty (60) days from the date of such damage, lessor shall have the option of terminating this lease by giving written-notice to lessee of such decision and the lease term shall terminate on the day such notice is given. notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the building shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty during the last twelve (12) months of the lease term, lessor shall have no obligation to rebuild the demised premises, and upon giving lessee notice of lessor's election not to rebuild the demised premises, this lease shall cease and determine as fully as if the date of such notice were the scheduled termination date of this lease. no compensation or claim or reduction of rent will be allowed or paid lessor by reason of inconvenience, annoyance, or injury to business arising from the necessity of repairing the demised premises or any portion of the building however the necessity may occur. ai. default of lessee if (i) lessee shall fail to pay any monthly installment of monthly base rent or any other rent as reserved hereunder when and as the same are due (although no legal or formal demand shall have been made therefor), or (ii) lessee shall violate or fail to perform any of the other conditions, covenants or agreements herein made or imposed upon lessee, and such violation or failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof to lessee from lessor (provided that, for any default which cannot reasonably be cured within said ten (10) day period, the cure period therefor shall be extended for such time as is reasonably necessary to effect a cure of such default (but in no event beyond forty-five (45) days after delivery of notice of such default), on the conditions that lessee immediately commences to cure such default and diligently pursues such cure to completion, and that, promptly upon determining that the aforesaid ten (10) day cure period is inadequate, lessee shall deliver notice to landlord of the steps being taken to cure such default and the amount of time reasonably estimated by lessee to effect such cure; but provided further that, no notice or cure period shall be required to be provided with regard to any intentional or willful default by lessee hereunder, or with regard to any default which (a) by its nature cannot be cured (or cannot be cured within the aforesaid forty-five (45) day period), (b) constitutes a hazard to the health and/or safety of any occupant of the property, (c) has caused the insurer of any policy of insurance on the property to issue a notice of cancellation of such policy, (d) involves the failure by the lessee to maintain any insurance required to be maintained by lessee hereunder, or (e) subjects landlord to the risk of civil or criminal liability, fine, penalty or prosecution), or (iii) if (a) lessee becomes "insolvent," as defined in title 11 of the united states code, entitled "bankruptcy," 11 u.s.c. section 101, et seq. (the "bankruptcy code"), or under the insolvency laws of any state, district, commonwealth or territory of the united states of america ("insolvency laws"), (b) a receiver or custodian is appointed for any or all of lessee's property or assets, or if there is instituted a foreclosure action on any of lessee's property, (c) lessee files a voluntary petition under the bankruptcy code or any insolvency laws, (d) there is filed an involuntary petition against lessee as the subject debtor under bankruptcy code or any insolvency laws, which such petition is not dismissed within thirty (30) days of filing or results in issuance of an order for relief against the lessee as debtor, or (e) lessee makes or consents to an assignment of its assets, 13 14 in whole or in part, for the benefit of creditors, or a common law composition of creditors, or (iv) the demised premises being abandoned, vacant or deserted and remaining so for five (5) days (provided that, vacating the demised premises shall not constitute a default hereunder, so long as (a) lessee shall notify lessor not less than ten (10) days in advance of vacating the demised premises that lessee intends to vacate the demised premises, (b) lessee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect such insurance endorsements as shall be required in order to assure that all insurance required to be maintained by lessee hereunder shall remain in force notwithstanding that lessee has vacated the demised premises, and (c) lessee shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the demised premises are secure against unauthorized entry during such period(s) as the demised premises shall remain vacant), then and in any of said events this lease shall, at the option of lessor, cease and terminate and shall operate as a notice to quit, any notice to quit or of lessor's intention to re-enter being hereby expressly waived, and lessor may proceed to recover possession under and by virtue of the provisions of the laws of the state of virginia, or by such other proceedings, including re-entry and possession, as may be applicable. if lessor elects to terminate this lease, everything herein contained on the part of lessor to be done and performed shall cease without prejudice, however, to the right of lessor to recover from lessee all rent accrued up to the time of termination or recovery of possession by lessor, whichever is later. upon the occurrence of an event of default as aforesaid, at lessor's option (either with or without terminating this lease), the demised premises may be relet by lessor for such rent and upon such terms as lessor, in lessor's sole discretion, shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, and, if the full rent hereinabove provided shall not be realized by lessor, lessee shall be liable for all damages sustained by lessor, including, without limitation, deficiency in rent, reasonable attorneys  fees, brokerage fees, and expenses of placing the demised premises in first class rentable condition. any damage or loss of rent sustained by lessor may be recovered by lessor at lessor's option, at the time of the re-letting, or in separate actions, from time to time, as said damage shall have been made more easily ascertainable by successive re-lettings, or, at lessor's option, may be deferred until the expiration of the lease term, in which event the cause of action shall not be deemed to have accrued until the date of expiration of said lease term. if lessor should commence any summary proceeding for non-payment of rent by lessee or to recover possession of the demised premises, lessee shall not interpose any counterclaim of any nature or description in any such proceeding. upon the occurrence of an event of default hereunder, provided this lease shall not be terminated, lessor shall, in addition, have the option to either (i) declare the rent reserved for the next succeeding six (6) months (or such lesser period as lessor deems appropriate) immediately due and payable, or (ii) require lessee to deposit with lessor an additional security deposit in an amount not to exceed six (6) months' monthly base rent. the provisions contained in this section shall be in addition to and shall not prevent the enforcement of any claim lessor may have against lessee for anticipatory breach of the unexpired lease term. in the event that lessee continues to occupy the demised premises after the expiration of the lease term, with the express or implied consent of lessor, such tenancy shall be from month to month and shall not be a renewal of the term of this lease or a tenancy from year to year. all rights and remedies of lessor under this lease shall be cumulative and shall not be exclusive of any other rights and remedies provided to lessor under applicable law. 22. waiver if under the provisions hereof lessor shall institute proceedings and a compromise or settlement thereof shall be made, the same shall not constitute a waiver of any covenant herein contained nor of any of lessor's rights hereunder. no waiver by lessor of any breach of any covenant, condition or agreement herein contained shall operate as a waiver of such covenant, condition, or agreement itself, or of any subsequent breach thereof. no payment by lessee or receipt by lessor of a lesser amount than the rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest stipulated rent nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying a check for payment of rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction and lessor may accept such check or payment without prejudice to lessor's right to recover the balance of such rent or to pursue any other remedy provided in this lease. no re-entry by lessor, and acceptance by lessor of keys from lessee, shall be considered an acceptance of a surrender of the lease. 14 15 bb subordination this lease is and shall automatically be subject and subordinate to the lien of any and all mortgages (which term "mortgage" shall include both construction and permanent financing and shall include deeds of trust and similar security instruments) which may now or hereafter encumber or otherwise affect the real estate (including the building) of which the demised premises form a part, or lessor's interest therein, and to all and any renewals, extensions, modifications, recastings or refinancings thereof. in confirmation of such subordination, lessee shall, at lessor's request, promptly execute any requisite or appropriate certificate or other document. lessee hereby constitutes and appoints lessor as lessee's attorney-in-fact to execute any such certificate or certificates for or on behalf of lessee, in the event lessee fails to execute and return the same within ten (10) days after delivery of lessor's request. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, any beneficiary under any mortgage shall have the right, at its election (which election may be exercised unilaterally by said beneficiary executing and filing a notice thereof for record with the clerk of the circuit court of fairfax county, virginia, at any time prior to said beneficiary commencing foreclosure proceedings pursuant to such mortgage) to subordinate the lien of such mortgage to the lease to the extent set forth in such document and thereupon the lease shall be deemed prior to such mortgage to the extent set forth in such document without regard to their respective dates of execution, delivery and/or recording. in that event, to the extent set forth in such document, such mortgage shall have the same rights with respect to this lease as would have existed if this lease had been executed, and a memorandum thereof recorded prior to the execution, delivery and recording of the mortgage. lessee agrees that in the event that any proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of any such mortgage, lessee shall attorn to the purchaser at such foreclosure sale, if requested to do so by such purchaser and to recognize such purchaser as the lessor under this lease, and lessee waives the provisions of any statute or rule of law, now or hereafter in effect, which may give or purport to give lessee any right to terminate or otherwise adversely affect this lease and the obligations of lessee hereunder in the event that any such foreclosure proceeding is prosecuted or completed. any mortgagee, purchaser at foreclosure, or assignee of lessor who requests such attornment shall not (a) be bound by any prepayment of rent for more than one (1) month in advance (lessee hereby acknowledging and agreeing that lessee shall have no right to, and shall not, prepay rent more than one month in advance of its due date, and that rent shall be payable after any such foreclosure, purchase, or assignment, in case of a requested attornment as aforesaid, in accordance with the provisions of this lease as if such prepayment of rent for more than one (1) month in advance had not been made), nor (b) to be bound by any amendment to this lease which was not approved by such mortgagee prior to the foreclosure or assignment, nor (c) be subject to any defense which lessee might assert against lessor, nor (d) be liable for any defaults (including defaults of a continuing nature) by any prior landlord, including the lessor, or for the return of any security deposit except to the extent the mortgagee or such purchaser actually received the same, in cash or in kind, and such security deposit has been segregated and identified as such by lessor in the ordinary course of business. 24. condemnation if the whole or a substantial part of the demised premises shall be taken or condemned (the terms  taken" and  condemned" as used herein being deemed to include any deed given in lieu of or under threat of taking or condemnation) by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, then the lease term shall cease and terminate as of the date when title vests in such condemning authority, and lessee shall have no claim against lessor or the condemning authority for any portion of the amount that may be awarded as damages as a result of such taking or condemnation or for the value of any unexpired portion of the lease term. the monthly base rent, however, shall be abated on the date when such title vests in such condemning authority. if less than a substantial part of the demised premises is taken or condemned by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, the monthly base rent shall be equitably adjusted on the date when title vests in such condemning authority and the lease shall otherwise continue in full force and effect. for purpose of the article, a substantial part of the demised premises shall be considered to have been taken if more than fifty percent (50%) of the demised premises are untenantable by lessee. 15 16 25: rules and regulations lessee shall, and shall cause lessee's employees, agents, officers, contractors, licensees and invitees to, abide by and observe the rules and regulations attached hereto as exhibit c. lessee, its agents and employees, contractors, licensees and invitees shall abide by and observe such other rules or regulations as may be promulgated from time to time by lessor for the operation and maintenance of the building provided that the same are in conformity with common practice and usage in similar buildings and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this lease and a copy thereof is sent to lessee. nothing contained in this lease shall be construed to impose upon lessor any duty or obligation to enforce such rules and regulations, or the terms, conditions or covenants contained in any other lease as against any other tenant, and lessor shall not be liable to lessee for violation of the same by any other tenant, its employees, agents, business invitees, licensees, customers, clients, family members or guests. 26. right of lessor to cure lessee's default if lessee defaults in the making of any payment or in the doing of any act herein required to be made or done by lessee, then lessor may, but shall not be required to, make such payment or do such act, and the amount of the expense thereof, if made or done by lessor, with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date paid by lessor, shall be paid by lessee to lessor and shall constitute additional rent hereunder due and payable with the next monthly installment of monthly base rent; but the making of such payment or the doing of such act by lessor shall not operate to cure such default or to estop lessor from the pursuit of any remedy to which lessor would otherwise be entitled. any installment of rent which is not paid by lessee within ten (10) days after the same becomes due and payable shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the date such installment became due and payable to the date of payment thereof by lessee, plus a late charge of 10% of the rent payments not received by lessor by the 10th of the month due, and such interest and late charge shall constitute additional rent hereunder due and payable with the next monthly installment of rent. the imposition of late charges or interest will not be deemed to excuse the untimely payment of rent. 27. no partnership nothing contained in this lease shall be deemed or construed to create a partnership or joint venture of or between lessor and lessee, or to create any other relationship between the parties hereto other than that of lessor and lessee. 28. no representations by lessor neither lessor nor any agent or employee of lessor has made any representations or promises with respect to the demised premises or the building except as herein expressly set forth, and no rights, privileges, easements or licenses
